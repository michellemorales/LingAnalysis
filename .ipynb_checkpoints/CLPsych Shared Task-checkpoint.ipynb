At the moment the ball is in my court, but I'm having trouble throwing it. I think right now I need to talk this over with someone before diving in and making any deicisons where this is concerned.

      "Last night I told a male friend of mine I wanted to try ice 'the different way'. I have only ever smoked it on occasion usually when it was supplied for free, alcohol has always been my vice. However recently I found myself sliding deeper down the path of self destruction trying to feel something wether it was good or bad. My conscience and my whole body for that matter screamed at me not to allow him to &nbsp;but something inside me wanted the excitement and the vulgur dirty feeling of doing something bad. I won't lie the rush was quite euphoric but was it worth comprising my values and hating myself for the following 24hrs? The obvious answer is no. I feel ashamed and dirty. My dilemma lies in my complete ignorance for my true values to choose to do something that I know will damage me and I will regret. It is as if I am punishing myself or I have some kind of sick attraction to being screwed up. I spent the last 24hrs in hospital because my comedown was so self hating I feared what I may do if left alone with my thoughts. I recounted my same old sob story of an emotionally abusive relationship at 19 and my addiction to alcohol from the age of 14 and my father being an alcoholic and suffering from bipolar. The counsellor kept emphasing that I had to 'let it go'. It has dawned on me that my anxiety my depression and alcohol abuse have become my identity and a label to hide behind. I don't know anything else I am good at being a chaotic mess. It is a terrifying feeling to me to take the steps to recovery. After today I feel a little more excited than terrified to start addressing my issues discovering my real self and becoming someone I'm proud of.

      "@moonwalk  I tried explaining to them that I have a full time job so I can't log in between 12:30 and 4 on Tuesday and they said \"oh you might just have to make adjustments, either way speak to your counsellor about it on Tuesday\" which makes absolutely no sense, considering 3 seconds prior to that I told them I couldn't make it on Tuesday. Like what is going on in their heads!? I go to headspace which is uh... it's alright, it will sort of have to do. It's just the in between I struggle the most with and doesn't help I have gone without an appointment for 3 weeks or more because I have been away.\n",

      "Its been almost a year and a half since i moved to Australia to pursue a masters degree. During all this time, i have made no friends at all. I mean i tried by best in keeping informal relationships with people and going above and beyond but no one ever follows up.   &nbsp;   My daily routine involves going to class, coming back, sleeping, cycling for 20 kms in the morning (40 kms on the weekends). Rinse, wash, repeat. I made a couple of acquaintances last year with a couple of people i was living with.   I invite them to my place now and then to watch movies, and i try to be best to host them. I host wonderful dinner parties too with gourmet dishes (since i was previously have experience as a chef). They have a wonderful time, but after that they never seem to follow up. It's like i am always putting my foot forward for people, be it during group meetings for university or having people come over. I am almost never invited for that \"drink\" after class or that general hangout. In fact, i never been invited by anyone i know to do anything. I always take the initiative and recently i have become so apathetic about it. The only person i consider as a friend is female but i try so hard to make plans with her and its a hit and miss. I took her once for a concert on my expense, amongst other stuff. But even she doesn't follow up on how i am or what i am doing.   I feel hopeless and i never seem to have the motivation to do anything. Even study. It's like i am living in a loop where i only hear myself in my head. I am generally a nice person, quite the extravert and can talk about anything. But most of my conversations with people have no effect. I keep analyzing myself to see what my discrepancies are. I always feel that i am making an effort to keep up a \"social front\" but nothing seems to work. I always keep reminding myself that \"things will get better\" and i always keep a cheerful and humorous attitude to the people i meet. But deep inside, i feel so empty.   I spend my free time doing long distance cycling and often release all my aggression on those long bike rides. Besides that, i have absolutely no one i can rely on. I feel like screaming most of the time to just release the frustration, but i feel absolutely hopeless at the end of the day.   &nbsp;   Because of this, i even started smoking like a chimney and this adversely affects the only release that i have which is cycling. I often feel my chest burn up and i feel absolutely hopeless of the situation i am in at the moment. I seriously have no idea what to do, i am trying my best. What am i exactly doing wrong?   &nbsp;   I have recently become so apathetic about everything. I don't talk to my folks back home, my friends from my country don't follow up on me (most of the time i do, just to check up on them and see how they are doing and thats it). I feel like giving up and just keeping everything to myself. I am seriously worried of feeling absolutely numb about everything and i fear i am going to become devoid of any emotion if i keep threading on this course. I am seriously trying my best to manage. But what i am i missing? I really need the help and support otherwise i feel i am going to become apathetic.\n",

You're definitely not overreacting, some people have different views and opinions on drugs and drug use and this is yours. If your husband is disgusted in himself for smoking in front of your child, then it shows that he might understand that you don't want it. Try to talk to him more, tell him why exactly you don't want it. Explain to him you don't mind it with his friends but near your children is a 'no no'.  When you see it happening or after something has happened, ask him why he did. Find his reasoning. Your child is still young, so don't let him see you fighting, as my mum says, children are like sponges, they soak up everything around them. But also make sure they understand that they are not allowed to do it.   You could also ask him to talk to other people about his addiction, to see if that can help him.   Best of luck, N1ghtW1ng\n",

      "Hey  @animallady   If your husband doesn't take things seriously, still let him know. At least that you're having some trouble and apologise for any lashing out at him. This way, you have told him and he knows.   I noticed that there wasn't any excerise on what you do. I think that excerise is a good way to release energy. This way, you might have less energy for hitting things. Going for a quick jog, walk, run. Doing some push ups, sit ups, jumps, just excerise of any kind to release energy.  Something else you could do is teach yourself how to punch properly. Practising stance, posture, energy, form. Good for self defense and release. Practising on soft items (pillows for example). ONLY on soft items can also help. It gives you something to it but won't hurt and will teach you something.   Something else I used to do was throw things around in my room. Soft things like my stuffed toys. I would also kick my bean bag around for a little while. It is exhausting trying to kick the bean bag around and doesn't hurt.   Adding one new thing every day to your schedule can add something new. Pick up a new book to read and read a few chapters every day. Go out somewhere and read there instead of in your bedroom. Even go windowshopping if that's something you're into.   There are many things out there for you to try, it might take awhile but you'll find something.\n",

      "Continuing... (because I went over the character limit... whoops)     &nbsp;     Neg: &nbsp;Rightio, that other negative. Around birthdays and christmas time gift giving seems like a natural part of the season. Which is why I don't feel as much guilt when given gifts but it's still there hanging over my shoulder, dragging me down. Because so often my family doesn't get it right and the gifts, they remain unused. A waste of money, just sitting there. Sometimes handed down but otherwise just wasted. And I feel at fault because they were for me, I should be thankful that I'm even receiving anything but all I feel is guilt and annoyance because my family just doesn't get me. I feel jealous of my younger cousin and brother who get cool things, things I would like, and I get the things my other cousin or sister would like. It's not right, socially, to be feeling jealous, guilt and annoyance in a 'jolly' season where I should be grateful, happy and... sombre? Humble even? And the worst part is I can't reprociate their gifts. I can't buy something for someone else without help because I just don't know people, not very well at least. Which makes me feel more guilty because all I can do is try to look happy and smile and say thankyou. Like I'm supposed to. Ugh, I want to give my families gifts but I can't because I don't know how, how to buy something for them they'd want or how to give without worrying about what they think. Whether they'd think or say 'oh you shouldn't have!' It's meant pleasantly, oh you shouldn't have bought something for me, I don't need/want anything! But it doesn't feel like it, it feels like they are downplaying your gift, saying your gesture is wasted.&nbsp;    Pos: &nbsp;I am, obviously, way overthinking this. Your family, while completely messed up and slightly misunderstood, are slowly getting better. Their gifts are something you'd use. Not a selfish thought, but it means they are understanding you better and what I like, what I love. And I'm being a little silly saying jealousy isn't in the seasons. Of course it is, not a highly advertised part but as a growing teenage girl feeling misunderstood by her family it's totally acceptable to feel jealous of your male relatives getting stuff you'd be interested it. I'm sure plently of people would feel annoyed too, especially sibling rivalries, being generally annoyed with your family. And you are grateful, and if not happy, but appeased. I feel content with where I am, happy that I am with my family. And sure, I suck at gift giving but lots of people do. Only last year was my family close to accurate, giving my foriegn money and travel things in preparation for my journeys. While it also sucks people aren't always straight forward with what they want, I know what some of the people in my life like and enjoy. And that's okay. And the gesture isn't being downplayed by the phrase 'you shouldn't have'. Being honest I don't know what it means but I honestly don't remember encountering it myself and I doubt I will. It's just something I've read and seen/heard on the various things I've watched. Nothing to fear, and even if it does happen, tone and body language also mean a lot. The phrase itself seems somewhat harsh but with welcoming body language and a soft, happy tone it means something else.   &nbsp;    Neg: &nbsp;People are hard to talk to. And I can't manage very well. At all.    Pos: &nbsp;Hahaha. I've created LIL for this, Laugh Inside Loudly, for those quiet moments when you are LOL but not making any sound (or even movement) to show laughter. Because I can assure myself that I have made at least two friends that I will hopefully stick with. Even more people that are more than aquantainces but I don't know if the word friend fits.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Neg: &nbsp;I'm absolutely terrible at making my own friends. Just look at my track record. My best friend from early age, our families have been friends for a long time. My school friends, my mum introduced me to them and then left me there. A friend I made on my own, gone. More friends I've tried to make are gone. Even on my trip it felt like a friend I've made wasn't really a friend, just circumstances left us to be 'friends'.&nbsp;    Pos: &nbsp;Hush darling, I would say to myself. I've changed a lot, still not the best judge of character but I'm getting better. And my friend who I sometimes feel like it a 'friend'. She's speaks another language natively, and she was with her other native friends. They are my friends too, but sometimes it can be difficult speaking another language and she just didn't want that. And we are in the same school and see each other a lot. I'm getting better at friend-making. And that's good.   &nbsp;    Neg: &nbsp;Walk in to the restuarant near-first. Sit down at a lovely, and empty, (four person) table. Watch patiently as people move around you and sit at other tables. Feel your hope for friends dim, see&nbsp;your three friends sit somewhere else. Watch as the restuarant is almost full, your table still empty. Sigh deeply because you feel alone. Force a smile as late people are directed to your lovely and still empty table.&nbsp;   Every. Bloody. Time.&nbsp;    Pos: &nbsp;Not always restuarants but it still hurts of course. But that's expected, I don't mind being by myself but alone... except I'm not alone, not really. I confessed to the people who sat down and they said, yeah it's the same with us. I couldn't help think that they still had each other while I was alone but, her meaning was clear, I'm not the only one it happens to.&nbsp;    More Pos: &nbsp;You don't call out to people, so they can always think the seats are taken. It didn't always happen and it also happened less towards the end. You even had an amazing friend who saw you by yourself and moved to sit with you so you weren't alone. This negative probably won't leave for awhile, maybe not at all. It'll happen occassionally but what's important, and what shines it out and throws it in that 'do not look, listen or touch' drawer is that you do have friends. People who will sit with you, or just general people who will if you encourage. I'm shy, reserved, people might think I want to be alone and leave it at that. I have friends who will sit with me and even if they don't, they're still willing another time.   &nbsp;    Neg: &nbsp;It seems to be taking me forever to actually fall asleep, which is becoming increasingly annoying. My head won't stop running, it won't even quiet down, and I just toss and turn for close to an hour.    Pos: &nbsp;It's a pleasing feeling to wake up in the morning (except to alarms but we all know that feeling  ) knowing that I've fallen asleep. Even though I'm usually still tired.   &nbsp;   Just one more.... (this involves sexuality and sexual topics, if that makes you uncomfortable, you can skip over it.  )   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;    Neg: &nbsp;My head likes stories and sometimes these stories can be sexual. The problem is I am uncomfortable around those things and it just feels like I'm fighting against myself. My brain, thoughts and body are all fighting against each other and it's getting near too much.    Pos: &nbsp;I know where I stand and where my feelings sit on this particular topic. While your head might go a little too far and I'm left feeling uncomfortable it's okay because it will go away. It's alright to be confused but I know that I'm asexual. I know that I will never have sex. And I'm okay with it too.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   That's better. But now sleep and I'm sorry if refering to myself as 'you' got confusing. It's what I do when I pep-talk myself.\n",

      "It's been awhile but I need to get some stuff off my chest.    &nbsp;     Neg:  &nbsp;My mental stories aren't always pleasant, but now they are even more linked to my real world and it's not good. Because a small part of me kind of wants it to happen, as terrible and disturbing as they are.     Pos: &nbsp;That's all they are, stories. I'm a creative person, stories are my thing, daydreaming different things is something I enjoy and sadness, that's my element in stories. I know my way around it more or less, it's my stories focusing around what I'm good at writing about. And I love being in stories, which is why I want them to happen, because then the story would be real, and that would be cool to me. Not because what's happening but because it's a story become real.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Neg: &nbsp;I couldn't stop myself from freezing up around Jayden. Their presense and warm, cheerfulness just freaked me out. Some part of me feels that they were doing it intentionally, to get that uncomfortable feeling from me and that frozen state. I kept telling myself I wouldn't but each time I kept freezing up. Stupidly hopeless in the face of social interaction.    Pos: &nbsp;You've reached out to them, kind of, and are breaking down whatever it is that makes them in particular so uncomfortable. I think I know, I almost know, the reason why too. The opposite in personality social-wise. Their outgoingness and my ingoingness conflict so their direct openness to me just didn't work with my ingoingness so I froze.   &nbsp;    Neg: &nbsp;My new family don't have the middle-ground so to speak. There's only yes or no and I can't handle that very well. It's hurting me emotionally because they'll ask me something \"where do you want to eat?\" and I might want nothing, maybe a cheap take out place or I could be in the mood for something fancy but my brain won't let me make that choice because I really don't mind, I don't want my decision to get in the way of what they'd rather do but they don't accept that. Same with choices, \"rice or potato?\" I can't choose, I might want potato but I'd be fine with rice if that's what they'd want but I'm in a position where my choice appears to be, the first one, in an unrealistic, broad way of putting it.&nbsp;    Pos: &nbsp;I really don't know about a positive for this. Where is the positive in being constantly indecisive in your head? I can't make proper decisions, I've rellied on my parents to do that instead, my friends. But that's a negative. The positive about this is that I know that I can give up what I want for a friend. I am happy letting them be happy, which makes us both happy. And I know that I'm not all that indecisive. I make the important choices, I make the minor choices and I choose which ones to let go for the sake of my friends and family. Because those choices aren't all that important in the long run and making sure my friends and family are happy is important. The important choices, those I know I will never change, but some can be simmered. And I know that as long as it doesn't make me too uncomfortable (because a little discomfort isn't a horribly bad thing because it could (and mostly is) related to being outside my comfort zone and I am somewhat happy to stretch it)) I am happy to do it.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Neg: &nbsp;I feel silly buying things for myself. I don't mind buying food for myself, or books for writing in, perhaps a pen or pencil if I'm feeling generous but 'gift' things? It feels selfish, wasting my money on those things. For example, on my trip around Europe I bought two decks of cards, two key chains and a sculpture for myself. (admittedly one keychain was for my brother but... don't tell him  ) But I feel guilty about wasting the money on those things. They are just possessions, I don't need them so why should I have them? Things are expensive, or even if they are cheap, that money could be put elsewhere. Schooling is expensive, food is expensive, housing is expensive. Everything is expensive but here I am wasting money on gifts that don't serve any purpose aside from hanging. The playing cards serve some purpose but I already have so many, why more? I'm not a collector exactly so, it feels like a waste. I try to be careful with money and other's money too. I feel immensly guilty when people buy things for me. Not so much around my birthday and christmas, because those are typically social gift-giving events but when it's something I won't use, it feels silly, there's another negative in here that I'll elaborate on in a sec or hundred but... money is precious, sort of and I feel like I'm wasting it.    Pos: &nbsp;Shush. I say just shush. It's okay to feel silly buying yourself things. But do you know what else you bought? A shirt, jewelry and magnets. And postcards. Not all of the things I've bought were for me. I'd done buying for people, and it was Italy! The playing cards had landmarks on them, some cool stuff so they were worth it. The keychains, you have a collection. And the sculpture, well that would make a good gift to someone anyway. I'm already so careful with my money, this is a near-once in this lifetime opportunity and it was okay to exploit it. It's okay to sometimes spend a little too much. I know that I have a steady amount safely tucked away for occassional use and money coming in monthly. I have a good bunch of coins lying around the place and probably some hidden notes. There is nothing to feel silly, or ashamed, of by buying yourself these things because you've deserved them. A little treat for yourself after such a long trip.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    To be continued...\n",

I work with people. I am very good at my job. Always happy, smiling and very patient. At home and with those I love, I am not the same. I have good days. Laughing, fishing, just being lazy.

      "@blithe  it does a bit. But I've never felt able to share the struggles I've faced over the years, so it goes hand in hand I guess. Yes and no. I don't want to be the subject of town gossip. Not that my mum gossips much, but those she talks to and uses as part of her support do. I feel like telling her will then be told to people around us that I don't want to know. I just want to get better and have only the people I feel ok with knowing. I know I'm trying to control it too much, but I feel safer that way. And yes I'm very scare how she might react. It's what has kept me sharing a lot of things for quite some time. When it all first started several years ago, I kinda just thought that if I told her, she'd blame herself for not picking it up, for not acting on it. So I've hid it ever since. But that was just one influencing factor. There's quite a few others which I've been able to identify. I guess I just don't want to make a big scene out of it...\n",

Ah... questions......questions......Why ask question that cant be answered or can be aswered but you know you wont like that answer.Yes, people say that is called reality.So i ask people, how do you identify reality? By measuring how bad things are? People than say that is not always bad, it can be good aswell.Well i didn't &nbsp;believe them so i did some science.I've been doing this experiment for so long now, and i always get the same result:Reality is a measure of how bad things are, and it has a tendency to get worse.   But people are persistent....no no no you're wrong there is something wrong with your experiments.Then, i asked myself, maybe you are the problem,experiment is not valid if you use faulty measurement gear.So whats faulty here? Is it the people and the whole world, or is it just me........ITS THE WORLD i shouted loudly and laughed....   So i made a list:-   Social life: none,   Job:none,   Wealth:none   Intelligence:I cant test myself,well i did some IQ test but they are so unreliable its pitiful...

      "Re: how do i become a good role model?\n",
      "Hey  @j95   In my experience one of the best ways to be a role model for younger siblings is by trying your best in your own life. This doesn't mean not making any mistakes, but constantly trying and finding a way to get by despite anything you've done. Most of my older siblings have at some point either completely backflipped on life or gotten onto a completely wrong track, but I'm inspired by the way they turn themselves around and into something that will make them happy.   My best friend sees his older brother as a role model largely for a similar reason - his brother seems successful and most importantly happy.   Another really big aspect of seeing siblings as role models is them feeling like they're on your side or are a friend. The easiest way to do this is probably to take interest in them. So ask him about whatever you know is going on in his life and get involved if you can. Watch a show with him so that it feels like that's the show that belongs to the two of you, or introduce him to some of your favourite bands. For me and my friends, whenever our older siblings have shared that sort of stuff with us it immediately become somewhat special.  There's one last one and it fits in really well to the above two: Help him. Offer to help him with his school work or find a tutor. Help him learn about taking care of himself, for me one way one of my sisters did this that was wonderful was by always making me do a lot of the cooking when I was with her.  The headspace idea goes into this really well.  Doing any of these things would be wonderful. That you want to help him out and that he does come to you already means that you're doing something right.\n",

      "Not really sure how to phrase the title but this is the closest I can get to.    Simply put I read an article that made it seem as though being gay was not a permanent state. It mentioned something regarding sexual fluidity and something about 10 percent of each gender is fluid. This of course pretty much sent my head into a tail spin.     Mind you, before all of this happened I had no doubts about being attracted sexually and romantically to guys. I really only liked women as friends and I had a thing for seeing strong women in the media and such, but it was more of an admiration/ hero sort of thing. Now I'm doubting myself where none existed before. It's made my adoration for these women seem like something sexual and now my attraction towards men has dropped. It's almost like my brain is trying to prepare itself for some sort of eventuality where I turn straight or don't like men anymore. It's made it hard to deal with people and of course dealing with my boyfriend.     I know it's not a big chance, but the thought of just changing one day without any control on my part is scary. Especially when I spent a good deal of time coming to terms with being gay, now there is this possibility to be afraid of. I wish there was a way to know for certain if it happens but there is none. It's makes me wonder how real my affections were for men in the past, even now this attitude towards women almost feels forced and unnatural, while thinking about men just feels so right.    I wish I knew how to dea with these thoughts running about in my head.\n",

It is hard to speak up when you're feeling this way, so well done on starting a conversation about how you're doing.   &nbsp;   It is certainly difficult when you put in so much effort to making new friends and growing a new support network without the desired results.

You should be proud of everything you are achieving.   &nbsp;   I do know those feelings of exhaustion and frustration well and can assure you that you are not alone in just wanting something—anything—back. You sound like a caring person, genuine in your interest and generous with your time. They are wonderful traits to have and again, you should feel proud to offer this to others while you are working so hard yourself. Also know that sometimes we can experience feelings of isolation in spite of close friend and family networks.   &nbsp;   When dealing with feelings of isolation I find it helpful to focus on my favourite activities; it's a kind of self care that helps reframe priorities.

If this is the case I really want you to consider dropping it or at least deferring to see if having it taken away helps you. Right now it may not be much of a priority for you but it is certainly adding stress. A family may want what's best, but that doesn't mean that they know what's best.  You can be more successful through TAFE than uni. And right now it certainly sounds like you may be happier through TAFE than uni.   Even if you left, it is never too late for uni. You can always go back, it may not be the exact same path as before (though sometimes it will pretty much be) but there's still a way back.

      "Hi Guys,   &nbsp;   You all have helped me so much already over the years, but I'm really struggling right now, and it was at  @Sophie-RO 's&nbsp; suggestion that I am writting this tonight.   &nbsp;   As a lot of you know, I finally managed to see a GP about my mental health at the start of March. Since then I've been on this really scary rollercoaster which is really beginning to really destroy me. And I think I'm leting it...   &nbsp;   At first I was really confused on who to see, and decided to try my #1 preference, I tried several times, even eheadspace tried, but then she went on holidays over easter. With the suggestion of Eheadsapce, I began trying to reach another psych. #2. I managed to send an email over easter, and she tried to call me a couple of times, but I missed the calls due to work. She replied to my email saying she'd try again last week (but that never happened). I've been too scared to try calling her back. Hell I'm scared of anything at this point.   &nbsp;   Right now I'm torn between where to try now. I ran into my #1 preference tonight in the supermarket, and was reminded why I wanted to work with her. (Back story, she is the parent of a girl I studied on my last prac!)&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Either way I know I need to make that initial, retchred and horrible phonecall. And that is what I am really stuck on. No matter who I try to ring, I'm extremely scared, anxious. I can't even bring myself to hit call. And I just feel so terrible that I can't manage to do anything. It's all too hard.   &nbsp;   For those who have taken that step, how did you manage it? Did you feel incredibly anxious like me?&nbsp;   Does anyone have any advice or tips, anything to help me through? ( Right now I'm ready to give up on the whole notion of getting better, because it just doesn't seem possible right now.. )   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Thanks a bunch,   Bee\n",

He's got nobody else so if me reaching out to him breaks the trust we've worked so hard on building up, he's got nobody and i've lost someone pretty important. It could either go really wrong or really well...   thanks, i just worry about him thats all, once he started getting involved with the police and school started falling apart, somebody needed to step up and give him a hand, nobody else did, so now I am and i'll do absolutely anything for him any day, just have to make a start &nbsp;\n",

      "@camilorfris  having a relationship end can be a really emotional and upsetting time. You've taken a very positive step by joining Reach Out and talking about how you're feeling.   It's important to give yourself time and space to grieve, so you can process everything that's happened. Sharing your feelings with friends and family can really help you get through this period.   Speaking to a grief counsellor is another really positive way to help process the feelings you're having at the moment.  It sounds like you care about this girl a great deal, do you think there's a possibility you could both remain good friends some time in the future?\n",

      "Hey  @past_future  I saw your post on Sat and have been meaning to reply, but things have been pretty hectic for me. Congrats again on seeing your gp! I know firsthand how scary that is. It was similar for me too, the GP didn’t say “you’ve got ___” or “You’re ____” but instead she focused more on the feelings I was having and how I felt, which for me was enough. It was all I would have been able to cope with too! Also if you aren't happy with their response you can always try another gp, I know this will be hard, but it may be worth having  someone more empathetic.   I totally understand your fears with not having someone check up on you, I’m new to this all to, but maybe this is something you can bring up with whoever you decide to see? So they’re aware?  You asked for experiences with counselors, thus far my experience with Eheadspace has been amazing, and they've helped me move into face to face counselling so much. When I hadn't contacted them in a while they sent me an email asking how things were going. Our main goal was to get me into face to face support. Eheadspace has honestly been a huge help for me, and why I've tried so hard to get into face to face support, despite the troubles I've had...  I've also had good experiences with Kids Help Line. I was in contact very regularly for about 3-4 years, and slowly disappeared due to heavy study load and I felt they were pushing me too much into phone counselling, which I wasn't ready for...  In my experiences with these services, I'd also say yes the fear and struggle is worth it. Long term more so like Birdeye was saying in their post, but I found short term so many times I'd walk away feeling listened to, like someone cared - supported.   @Birdeye  Such detailed explanations! Thank you, this has helped me aswell!    I hope this has helped past_future\n",

      "Thanks a lot. I agree I'm being incredibly brave - I've never really found it at all difficult to talk about what is troubling me. Not at all. It's a great skll I possess. I don't think anyone should be afraid to speak up - but unfortunately it isn't always that easy. I can totally understand that.&nbsp;  This weekend I am feeling quite good. Definitely an improvement that's for sure,&nbsp; To answer your other question - sometimes talking to people online helps relieve the stress. But definitely not always.&nbsp;  I certainly do respect my friend very very very much - and I would be willing to do anything so as to maintain our friendship and make her as happy as possible. And I think I do a fantastic job of that. In fact, I caught up with her yesterday (even though it wasn't for long at all) and had a small talk about things. But it sucked we only spoke for about 50 minutes. We didn't get the chance for both of us to really talk about everything that has been going on for both of us. You know what I mean? When you catch up with friends who are particularly close, you want to be able to sit down for 3-4 hours and discuss all the things that have been going on for you; if you had any particular upsets since last catching up, what happened, how you dealt with it. How your friends family is doing and what they are getting up to, how your friends work is going, and if anything of note happened that they would like to discuss. A complete debrief you know! But that's just my opinion. It depends on the friend in question, I have friends that I don't talk about my person life to at all, and neither do they for whatever reason.&nbsp; Regardless of us not doing any of that, I'm not going to dwell on it and be complacent, that will only make me more upset. I'm fine with it - and I'm grateful we caught up at all you know?&nbsp;   Being at home is an amazing thing, I'm not sure about you - but I live alone. There's nothing inherently wrong with it, but it just does get lonely at times. It would be like that for most people I would imagine.&nbsp; Considering the torment and problems I had when living with my parents over two years ago, the fact that I am living on my own now completely free of any emotional abuse whatsoever. It's a truly magnificent thing - trust me! It's an enormous blessing and I am very very grateful. As you say the outside world&nbsp; can&nbsp; be dangerous - it depends upon if we reinforce the meaning of it. I just need to reinforce the fact that it is an okay thing, there is nothing terrible about it. I need to develop some new coping strategies to sort it out. I have every confidence I will.&nbsp; Personally though, I love going out and about. I love being in certain places. I love being in the city, but not when my anxiety decides to play up on its own accord. That simply does not help. It's like it has a mind of its own.&nbsp;  Funny you should mention it, I did speak to an online counsellor. But that didn't help at all. I just constantly had this sense (or a little person on my shoulder telling me) that they weren't listening to me and didn't really care at all. So I don't think I'll be going back to that any time soon. But that's fine, I'm doing pretty good. I'll talk to them again if I feel lonely. Maybe...&nbsp;\n",

I spoke with the psych last week, and the first apt time she had was next Monday on the 11th, otherwise it'd clash with work or TAFE which we decided not to do. So it's a whole-nother week I've got to wait to see her!   &nbsp;    Sophie-RO Yep it was a bit of a crisis point that I reached over the weekend! It was hard though to try and focus on something else. I don't know why I felt less fragile the next day, maybe it was that I was consciously trying to be more mindful of how I was feeling, and trying so hard not to push myself to any extent that would tip me over the edge again. I was definitely allowing myself more time and space emotionally. But really I can't recall anything that helped me feel better in the moment. It's hard, because as I sit here now, I don't actually remember feeling so bad that I wanted to end my life, which kinda scares me....    &nbsp;   &nbsp;    Neg:  Woke late again today. This is becoming too much of a habit Monday mornings.    Pos:  I got to TAFE in time to set up my area (despite not knowing what I was on)   &nbsp;    Neg:  My teacher didn't seem impressed that I wasn't sure what area I was on.    Pos:  Whatever. I'm doing the best I can, and right now if that means not writing out those plans than so be it. She will just have to accept that I'm doing the best and prioritising tasks. Right now, if I'm not keeping up with assessments how am I ment to with the weekly tasks? I'm setting myself boundaries and I'm trying so har to stick to them. Right now my health is more important than those tasks.   &nbsp;    Neg : Have more spots over my body. But only the ones on my chest sting and itch. Hmm.    Pos:  I saw my usual pharmasist this morning, she said to continue using the cream I got from the other chemist, and gave me another one to use alongside it, and to take these other tablets I had at home. She said that if it gets worse after a few days or doesn't improve after Friday to go see a gp.&nbsp;    Pos:  The pharmsist is one of the better ones in town, I've only found one other chemist I feel ok to walk in and ask for advice, the rest feel to lack some professionalism..&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Neg:  When I ran into one of my old TAFE teachers in coles today, I felt an urge to smile and say everything was going fine,  Pos: &nbsp;I fought it and opened up a little. Not only did I feel better opening up to her and letting some of the stuff out, I got a good response from her - one I should have expected, but didn't. I walked away feeling listened to and with a bit more confidence.\n",

      "Neg : Feeling overwhelmed by my assessments. Feeling like there is so much to do, all which requires so much thought processes, which I don't feel like I have right now. Feeling like of the time I've spent here at my desk I've achieved nothing.    Pos : I've made some progress. I need to remember I won't knock over a whole assessment in one afternoon! I need to remember to take regular breaks, long blocks don't work well for me. I have started my presentation, done nearly half a question. Small chunks at one time.   &nbsp;    Neg : Feeling very flat today. Not feeling like study but not feeling like being around people.    Pos : It's normal for me to flat today considering how bad I felt yesterday/last night/last few days. I need to be patient with myself, there will always be ups and downs and consequences for both.   &nbsp;    Neg : Parnoia thoughts were affecting me pretty badly during work today - it was so hard to challenge them. It got to the point I was close to walking away, and I was working independantly cleaning at that point. The fact that I'm considering leaving work early because of these thoughts is disturbing. I'm feeling very unstable in my emotions and decisions.    Pos : I'm noticing the strugle I'm having with these thoughts. This is something I need to bring up with the psych when I see her, and my gp in my follow apt in a few weeks. &nbsp;\n",

I'm proud of myself for persevering even though this has all been so scary and anxiety provoking. I'm proud that I've managed to start sharing things with my psych.\n",

It is clear from your posts that you are&nbsp;a deep thinker, intelligent and articulate, and the challenging questions from that sheet stand out as being something you could complete.   &nbsp;   No one should have to feel the sadness you are feeling, but know that you are not alone with your pain. It is great that you have turned to us, now keep going – is there someone you trust that you could get together with? Can you talk to your father about how the fight made you feel? Or could you write about your thoughts and feelings? Remember also to write about the things in your life that you value and appreciate, no matter how small they may seem to you.   &nbsp;   Please do give the Suicide Call Back Service a try.

I could even just defer it for a while and come back to it at a later date.   Yes it did. I've developed a decent relationship with them which is good.   &nbsp;   Neg: The shop didn't have the plug I need for my car stereo, so I need to look online. Which means I have to wait even longer to put my new stereo sytem in   Pos: On the bright side, it'll be done properly from the get go     &nbsp;   Neg: Feeling a little overwhelmed still by everything with my health. It's all happening and it's so hard not having anyone who I really trust to turn to and cry with. I have another gp apt tomorrow morning and am not really looking forward to it. SO I wrote a bit late night about whats been happening since I last saw her. Now it's just the giving it to her bit.   Pos: I wrote it incase I got stuck/anxious. It's already there so I don't have to try and think too much! It's enough detail that she can read it and know what's been going on, but it's not too much detail.   &nbsp;   Neg: I'm kinda just over the whole seeking help thing already, it's really taking a toll on me and I'm questioning if I was right to start thejourney when I did.   Pos: I made a promise to myself that I would do what it took to get better when I signed up with eheadspace last August/September (?) That's approx 10 months of really hard work! It's been about 7 months of working with the one clinician at eheadspace and 3 and a bit months since I first saw my GP!

It's just one huge stress cloud above my head which only grows as I work through it!     Pos: I'm slowly working through it. I will do my best. At the end it's all I can do.   &nbsp;   Neg: I've been chatting with an old high school friend and I'm starting to see why I didn't fight the friendship ending. I'm just feeling really judged and made to feel insignificant. I'm not feeling like I have a say in what I do at all. I'm realy wanting to just be free from all the drama. On one hand I want t patch things up, bu on the other, there is too much history and I don't want that in my life anymore. I don't think I'm ready to have a friendship with her.   Pos: I can get through this. I am not going to reply anymore on the topic, and say I've got study to do and am doing it.   I also need to see that she's changed. Our friendship was bad on both sides, and I know that part of me not wanting to resume or create a new friendship is because I haven't fully moved on or changed like I want to. I'm very much in a ccle right now of needing to be there for me, and not needing any pressure from others. And I feel like I just can't give anything to anyone right now.   &nbsp;   Neg: I'm kinda feeling a bit guilty because I've not done as much as I want, but I'm feeling so exhausted at the same time.

      "Thanks  @Sophie-RO &nbsp;sometimes this thread is the only thing keeping me moving forward... Sometimes the only reason I am able to see or even notice something has bee on my mind is when I wite it here. It seems to be a safe space for me. Really the only thing I'm doing to try and work through it, is trying to manage it with some breathing, distraction if possible at work. Its hard though because some days I just need to work beside someone to help calm the anxiety, where as other times I know I just need to be alone. And when I'm trying so hard not to let myself go into panic mode, it really drains my energy...   &nbsp;   At first thought, there isn't anyone I'd be feel ok to alk about this with. I mean with my colleagues, I don't know them well enough to know if that's something I could ask them. But also it would kinda feel weird. Going back to the GP early, I don't know, I haven' considered it, but it's not realy something I want to do, but I guess if it came down to it, I would. &nbsp;Making a thread seems fine, but I know it's internal - something inside of me i actually blocking me from taking that step! In regaurds to calling, I set myself a goal, I set a time, like today I told myself I would grab a recharge &nbsp;for my phone a couple days earlier so I had bonus talk to b able to ring the psych after work. Well after work, I thought about it, I brought up her number, but threw my phone onto the passenger seat instead of pressing the call button. Like my finger was right about it, and before it reached thes scre I gave up. So I really don't know how to approach it anymore. I don't understand why this is so hard for me. I struggle through 90% of things I try, but damned if I know why. I mean hell, I can talk myself out of anything faster than anyone can tell me what they want me to do. It's so frustrating.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Neg: I'm disliking this whole facebok thing of \"on this day\", I keep getting all these posts from like 4 years ago, reminding me of an ol friendship, reminding me of how I used to be. Giving me another thing to feel bad about, because I don't think I'm fully over that friendship yet.     Pos: I've tried making new friendships, I've been trying to move on from that friendship for too long now. I'm finding it hard now that I'm seeing them alot at work... I'm able to take a deep breath and act professionally like I do with other customers.   &nbsp;   Neg: Was going to ring the psych today. I chickened out again. Feeling bad about it. I mean if I can't even makethat damn call, how can I even expect to get better.   Pos: I got as far as bringing up her number again. I'm trying to call her, continually bringing up her number, maybe one day I'll be able to actually press call.   &nbsp;   Neg: Been in the wars recently, I'm either huring myself with the way I move, or I'm getting injured by the things around me, just yesterday I got scratched by a cat being cared of the vac, and I managed to get a nail in my foot! My muscle in my arm is also sore from lifting the heavy boxes at work :/   Pos: I've applied first aid to my arm/muscle, I've been using a muscle rub and heat/cold treatments. I'll take pain relief/nurofen for it tonight.\n",

For example if my father doesn't want to go to the doctor for something I'll ask him if he'd make me go for it, more often than not the answer is yes.

Unfortunately I haven't been able to keep on track with those 2 tasks she gave me, but I can always try again tomorrow. I don't expect to move mountains over night. Like  @Chessca_H &nbsp;said \"It's a process\"   &nbsp;   I spoke with Eheadspace yesterday, and the clinician I've been working with will email me in 2 weeks, but said to email her if things get really hard with my apts with the psych. She wants me to move forward, but doesn't want to throw me intot he deep end without support. They've been good with that.   &nbsp;    @Shadow &nbsp;that helps me feel a bit better about it all. she hasn't said how I can contact her outside of sessions, but I DO have her email and phone number.   &nbsp;    @Sophie-RO &nbsp;that's what Eheadspace said, about it taking a while. The clinician I was working with there said it'd probably take me quite a few sessions to really feel comfortable talking about it. Given how I was when I started working with them. I think I could eventually connect with her. She was so patient with me, but at the same time she was bluntly honest which I think will take a bit of adjusting to, but I should be right.   &nbsp;   Thank you  @N1ghtW1ng &nbsp;I think that was exactly what I needed to read!   &nbsp;    @Chessca_H &nbsp;that's true, I guess I'm just comparing how I'm able to be so open with Eheadsapce yet, I closed off so much with the psych. I forgot the whole starting fresh thing. I honestly didn't think about how different things work for different people. I'll definitely check out that thread. I don't think I have yet!   &nbsp;    @Birdeye  yeah I guess that's true. I just thought, I'd be able to be more calm but maybe not.. ohwell. That's a good idea, but I'm not 100% sure what exactly I'm scared/worried about with medication. She said she was the person to ask if I had any questions, and said there'd be minimal side effects with how we'd go about it.. Somewhere along the line she mentioned something about seeing a psychiatrist via video-link, but that it would be fairly simple as it's done with the gp. (I was actually surprised to hear we don't have any psychiatrists locally!) Yeah me and blood tests don't mix well. But her learning about that with me lightened the mood a little...

Once you start talking to them it gets a lot easier, its just a matter of approaching them. Remember there are people in the same position as you, and you're not alone in feeling this way.   Hope the best  .\n",

      "Hey  @Creativegirl12    &nbsp;   Firstly, glad to hear&nbsp;you are feeling good and wanting to do lots of things  &nbsp; I think&nbsp;getting distracted and behind in work is&nbsp;something that every uni student struggles with from time to time, especially when all those assignments start building up. If it makes you feel any better, I am 5 weeks behind on all my coursework and have no intention of starting tonight so I think we are in the same boat     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   I can really relate to what your saying. Its so hard to start uni work when your mood is all over the place- sometimes it feels like the last thing you want to do, and even if you manage to open a textbook it can feel&nbsp;impossible to concentrate. If it helps, what I do when I am in a low mood or finding it hard to concentrate is to do all the \"easy\" stuf that doesnt take much thinking - eg if its an assignment&nbsp;do the referencing and formatting, or even if you&nbsp;have lectures to watch choose the easier or more interesting topics.&nbsp;Usually I find that&nbsp;after making that first step I end up getting some work done.   &nbsp;   Perhaps you could even try some meditation or breathing exercises to help calm you down physically, and then your thoughts and concentration will probably follow   I also really like  @ElleBelle &nbsp;time management suggestion, I'm sure that could really help. Good luck!!\n",

      "&nbsp;   In the last 6 months since completing my first year at university and basically failing my last semester I found myself not wanting to continue attending uni but needing a break thus going back to work and applying for a TAFE course closer to home. In this 6 months I felt pressured&nbsp;to keep up the university externally because thats what my family expected.   Having TAFE fees to worry about every fortnight i have taken up 2 jobs and basically thrown university out of priority, but its always playing on my mind.   &nbsp;I think i have taken too much on because nothing works, did it ever?&nbsp;   My mother is a FIFO work on 4on/1off and since the beginning of the year I have seen her a total of 5 weeks as of this week, she is oblivious to what my life has become (everyone has) and spends the weeks home with a man who is still married to another when he feels like giving her attention or she spends it on her phone when i try my hardest to clear my week to spend some of the 6 days with her.&nbsp;   Again..... i cant take days off work...i have to pay for TAFE....cant miss TAFE because maybe ill get a job from that later......oh just recieved another uni email *delete* (\"maybe if i do that the assignment with disappear completely\")   When mum is away i live in a house alone (4 weeks) and many of it i find myself sobbing at the kitchen bench in my underwear thinking about what is going to happen when uni exam week comes along and how i have brought this on myself.   I feel like its too late to try but if i dont im going to blow it completely and lose my place at the uni.   &nbsp;   For the last 6 months I have had no enthusiasm to try repeating the units i failed lastyear, All i want now is to move on with my degree but i dont think i can have any hope at that even at a different university, even in another years time....   Theres so much pressure for me to make something of myself in order to support my sister whom has cerebral palsy once mum and dad are gone but i dont want to think about that either or how little time i spend with all three; mum, dad, my older sister.   &nbsp;   I dont want to think that my problem is that a big one but i just dont want to feel like this anymore, i dont want to keep this to myself anymore.\n",

I was told ot keep a diary and keep reporting them. I just need some evidence of her. Eiher photo or video, or someone sayin it as her...   &nbsp;   Neg: When texting a class member today, was starting to feel frustrated with the conversation, I felt like I was practically givinge her my answers, yet she still didn't understand. Despite my help, she posted in our facebook group asking for help. I felt kinda stupid for even trying, when it didn't feel like she was really listening to me.   Pos: I tried. That's all I need to remember, is I did my best. Texting isn't the greatest way to work on assessments with others. I really just need to focus on me and not worry too much about others.   &nbsp;   Neg: Felt really anxious when my phone went off alerting me of a new email. After looking at my phone the nerves just became more intense. Reading the email, initially, was kinda hard. Yet now it doesn't have that strong emotional response. Why do I get such a strong emotional response when I get such emails? Why do I start to fret every time my phone goes off?   Pos: Said email was Eheadspace letting me know they got in touch with the psych today. Hopefully it will make the initial apt a little easier. I know the emotional response is a sense of anxiety with not knowing why or who is trying to contact me. It's managable at least   &nbsp;   Neg: Part of me feels even more nervous to see the psych next week now that she knows a bit about me and some of what I've been going through.&nbsp;   Pos: I got Eheadspace to do this to help me, so I wouldn't have to start from ground 0. I will get through it.\n",

      "Hey&nbsp; @Titanomachina  &nbsp; I know how you feel. I more identified with being asexual but I really don't know where I sit anymore.&nbsp;    There are other types of attraction including sexual, romantic, sensual, platonic and more. Unless you see the women and think sexual things with them, feel that you want to, it's not sexual attraction. It could be more idealistic, that you want to be like them because you admire them.  Your attraction towards men could have dropped because you are happy with your boyfriend and no longer need to see another man in that way.   Stress could also play a part in these thoughts and feelings.   With the article, things can change. However someone's orientation is set. While it might fluctuate, it is still set. So while you might be gay, you might, once or twice, find an attraction to a woman however thinking of her as attractive doesn't change anything. You can still think 'that woman is attractive' however if you don't feel anything towards her, then there's no attraction. You can still acknowledge it. Did that make sense?  Wishing you the best  @Titanomachina . You are a strong, kind and amazing person!

      "I feel like I have tried everything else, so maybe thing will help. I can hid behind my screen yet at the same time feel like I am actually telling someone about my problem.   &nbsp;   I don't know why I hate myself.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Actually thats a lie, I know why. What I don't understand is why I can't convience myself that its all in my head. I live an extremly previliged life. I have an amazing family, great friends and honestly my life is pretty easy. I feel like I should be happy all the time, but the truth is that I am hardly ever happy. Yet no one seems to see that. I feel like I want to yell out for help because I am drowning yet I don't have a voice, and even if I did no one would be able to hear me anyways.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   I hate myself so mcuh. The only reason I continue to push through is because I love my family and friends and I know that their lives would not be easier without me, well at least not at first. My little sister is my best friend and I know she looks up to me and loves me and it would mess her up to know that I am messed up. She has a hard enough time with me away at college, I don't know what she would do if I was gone forever. My parents are the same way. They love me so much, and I know it. Thats why I can't talk to them though, they would be so destroyed to figure out that I am so f*$%ed up, they would feel like they failed me as my parents. Which of course isn't true. Its not their fault, they have only ever been supportive and loving.   &nbsp;   So on to why I hate myself.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   First, I am not a good person. I try, I really do. I volunteer, I love to help people and heal people. But I can do better, I still hurt people. Maybe its not intentional, but I do. I can do so much more for the world and yet I don't do it. How can I love myself knowing that I am not doing all the good I could be? Mother Theresa helped millions of people, and yet I am over here being selfish, watching netflix and feeling sorry for myself.   &nbsp;   Second, I am not smart. I don't get good grades. I can't even say that I try to get all As because I don't. I just feel like there is more to life then simply getting good grades. Thats when reality sets back in and I realize I need to do well in school to do well in life, at least according to socities ideals.   &nbsp;   Third, I have a hard time beliving that anyone likes me. Really, I question how much my friends want to be friends with me all the time. Why? Because I wouldn't want to be friends with myself. So why should they want to waste their time on me. I am in a Sorority and yet I feel all the girls are able to connect so much deeper then myself. I just have a really hard time making a deep emotional connection.   &nbsp;   Fourth, I have now had sex with 9 guys. I am a slut. I am 20 years old. The last one i stopped us as soon as we started because I knew that wasn't what I wanted. I hate myself so much for having sex. People tell you then to just stop but I spent my life growing up being told that I was attractive and having society drop my self worth to how much guys want me. Don't get me wrong, I wear the typical girl next door outfit. You know jeans and natural make up are pretty much my go to. Yet I never have a problem getting guys, in fact I have a harder time getting them to stay away. The things is that no guy wants to date me. I am the slam piece that they get to brag to their friends about. When I am really depressed I find a guy to adore me and to tell me that I am attractive and then they usual make a move, where that all leads to depends. Usually I don't stop it because I trust the guy and they are one of my friends, but then afterwards I hate myself for it so much that it causes me to feel ill.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Sorry for the long rant, I will probably have more to say later. I just had to get these thigs out because I don't know how much longer I can keep it all in.\n",

I eventually got up and went to work. I faced the world and smiled a little.   &nbsp;    Negative : Really struggled through my shift today. I was close to ringing my supervisor and saying I needed to leave the registers for a while, but a colleague relieved me for my break, however my break didn't help me much. I found it so hard to even focus on my breathing. It was soo hard. The 4.5 hour shift just felt too draining...    Positive : My colleague had amazing timing at coming to relieve me because I was so close to panic. I managed to the end of my shift. I kept trying to breathe deep, not focus too much on how quickly, but trying to just make sure they were controlled. As counting was only stressing me out even more.   &nbsp;    Negative : My gp was running late today, which heightened my anxiety. At first she didn't realise it was my 3month follow up apt. She also had no idea that the psych was meant to write a letter, so the psych either ran out of time or forgot. Meh. I just wanted to run away and hide. It was SO VERY hard not to close off and run. I didn't even hear her call my name the first time. Blergh.    Positive : I managed to say it was the follow up apt she wanted me to attend. She looked for said letter but couldn't find it. The gp apt overall was ok I guess.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Negative : Feeling very over it all right now. Feeling like just packing up and running away. I don't want to be here right now. I don't want to face anything in my life right now. It's all feeling too hard. I just want to rid it all.      Positive : I'm getting through one day at a time right now. I'm trynig SO HARD NOT TO STRESS over the following day. I will get through this. &nbsp;     Positive : I have 2 choices, I can contact Eheadspace or I can contact my psych. Right now I'm going to keep that in mind and try to calm my body and find a better space mentally.   &nbsp;    Negative : The gp asked some tough questions today. Some relating to SH &amp; suicide. I really didn't want to answer them. I felt too scared...    Positive : I answered them anyway. Because I knew it was better to be honest. I told myself that I told the psych, I might aswell let the gp know, afterall she is INVOLVED in my care right now.   &nbsp;    Negative : I forgot to ask the reception staff for an apt in 2 weeks when I finished today. I only realised when I got to the chemist.    Positive : I CAN book that online myself. Which might give me some freedom and make it a little easier.   &nbsp;    Negative : I'm not feeling very safe right now. My head is just ruminating on so many thoughts. I'm agitated and just wanting to be left alone. I'm not feeling able to make any clear rasional decisions right now. I'm kind of scared.    Positive : I can do some journalling to help with the supports. Being alone may help me calm down. I know where to find a list of numbers to call if I get really bad. I WIl make contact if I can't cope anymore. If it gets to that point, I WILL write it down for my psych.   &nbsp;    Negative : I don't feel like facing work tomorrow. It's an 8am shift and I'm tired of feeling so tired. I'm scared I'm going to feel really anxious again like today. I'm scared that it may get very busy and I'll be stuck at the registers. I'm scared of Sunday, being at the registers for 3 hours, I don't know if I'll cope being in express for that long again!    Positive : I just need to take it as it comes. I know if it comes to it, I feel like I could say to my weekend morning supervisor that I need some time away from the registers for a while. I'm sure she'll work something out if it gets to that.   &nbsp;    Negative : I don't want to go to prac next week. I don't feel emotionally or mentally stable enough right now. I have all these thoughts and worries about what could happen, worries abou worries and thoughts. I'm kinda scared of them. I'm scared that I won't know how to handle it if they arrise.    Positive : I'll attend the first day and see how I go. I will try my best. I have my psych to call on if I just can't cope with it. She gave me intructions to leave if I needed but to go back the following day. My teacher said to keep contact and only share what I was comfortable with. I HAVE this support this time.

If someone doesn't want to see someone then they won't tell them when they're next free.\n",

      "Hey  @Bee  I'm just... I'm super proud of you! Really. Even if it didn't go so well you did it, and I (and everyone else here) is super proud of you for that.   I can't really remember my first appointment but I don't have the same troubles with talking about my problems. Sorry that I can't be of much help there.   To answer your other question (the first one) I think that people find it easier to put themselves down because it is just that, easier. When you build yourself up, it can seem like a lot of work. You have to think about what you're good at, positive things(which you are amazing at, by the way) and putting yourself down is simpler.   Choosing sleep is definitely an alright choice, it's important to stay rested because a lack of sleep can sometimes make things worse.   You've got this  @Bee  because you are definitely so brave and we are all proud of you.\n",

It feels like first person, but in third. I'm gunning to read most of the books on my Kindle before asking for more. (So a month  )  I feel... all over the place. I almost broke down crying this afternoon because of my feet and shoes. (Seriously though, I weat two different sizes, check the size of my feet and it says I'm 6, try on those size shoes and they're too small. Ugh.) But I bought myself a cornetto to make up for it. I also spoke to two different shop assissants asking a question so that was awesome for me. But... The problem is most of thetime I feel physically, mentally and emotionally drained. I don't want to do anything, at all. At the same time I want to read, go walking, eat, sleep, sometimes cry or throw a fit.  The worst part is... I don't know who is me. I read so much, absorb myself into my books, my stories, shows, picking bits and pieces of different personalities and making them mine. I get so confuses because I'm scared of the dark but love darkness. I don't want to be alone but I love being by myself. For everything I hate, I love it(or an aspect of it) and it confuses me. I'm assertive, stubborn, but I let other people do want they want to do. I just... nothing is set. My pereonality changes but I suppose that is normal. Of course people change their likes, dislikes. Grow, adapt, evolve, change. It just feels like it's only me like this, who is changing without loosing the previous part so I'm left with the two me's.

      "Hey&nbsp; @Ennyjay &nbsp;and welcome to ReachOut!   &nbsp;   No one can really tell you&nbsp; how &nbsp;you should feel. Grief affects different people in different ways.&nbsp; This &nbsp;is a factsheet on common reactions to death and&nbsp; this &nbsp;is about working through grief. And&nbsp; here &nbsp;are a list of stories all about loss and grief that you can search through if they might help you. (All the links open in a new page  )&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Some people hide their grief and continue about their lives while others are more open about it. Everyone reacts in a different way depending on different factors like who they are grieving, their relationship with them, what is going on in their life at the moment (for example, a busy person might not find the time to grieve) and so on. It's okay if you don't feel like crying, you might not even feel anything. In fact, everyone in my family reacts a little different to grief. My mother is more inward, so she is strong for us so to speak. My father will usually hide his grief but will often be a little more angrier and touchy about things, it's similar with my brother although he will cry more. My sister will just cry, be sad about it, open about her grief. I'm more inward and sometimes can be touchy. I don't cry and I often don't know what to feel. I confessed to my friend once after my grandmother had passed away a few weeks ago and told her I haven't cried. Honestly, I can't remember what she said, but that wasn't a bad thing. It was just my way of dealing with grief.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   If you feel yourself about to cry, try not to hold it back. If the situation calls for it, try to excuse yourself so you can go someplace quiet. Let yourself let it out, I personally feel better after crying. Even if you don't feel anything, that doesn't matter. You're not alone in feeling that. Know that no matter how you do feel, it isn't the wrong way to feel, only you know which way is best for you.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   N1ghtW1ng\n",

While he was sick I was away at military training and I couldn't be with him. I was alone and away from all my family and friends. I was allowed to leave once to see him before he died but only for a couple days. While this was happening, my boyfriend at the time was deployed. I cheated on him. I returned home in September and told my boyfriend the truth in January (he returned home in November). He broke up with me. He was gone along with the dog we had shared for the last three years. All this loss sent me spiraling but I had started to work through it. A couple days ago I was sexually assaulted by someone I believed to be my friend. I feel very anxious, sad, guilty, and scared all the time now. Sometimes these feelings hit me so hard all I can do is lay down and cry.

We had our first child a little over a year ago and he did stop smoking for my pregnancy, socially smoking twice during my pregnancy which I didn't have a problem with, as it wasn't around me or affecting anyone but himself.

I was so scared to let her in.&nbsp;    Pos : I turned up! I stayed the full length of the appt! I tried to talk to her. I tried so hard to let her in.&nbsp;   The psych was understanding and did her best to help me through it. She explained some things and made it seem a little less daunting. She gave me a breathing exercise to try everyday until our next apt. and she said to write down how it was, to share with her next week.   &nbsp;    Neg : I feel bad because I wasn't able to open up to her and tell her what was really going on. It all just felt too hard.    Pos : I can always write it down and try to read it to her next week. Or I can just hand it to her.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Neg : Part of me is really scared to open up because everytime I've let people in before it has always come back to bite me on the bum. Like now, with things at work, with an old friend. I'm scared that someone will see me walk in, will see how long I've been at the chemist and know I'm seeing a psych. Part of me is so scared that people will judge me. Part of me I guess is scared of being judged by her. As that's all I've ever known. People I've been around in the past have not been accepting of mental health issues, has that scared me off??    Pos : I need to remember that what I share with her is bound by confidentiality! And that there's only 1 thing that can break that without my consent, which is in the event she is worried about my or someone elses safety! It doesn't make sense me being scared of her judging me, when this is the profession she's walked into, it's her job not to judge, but to listen and help me work through it.&nbsp;   I don't have a positive for the fear of others judging me yet.   &nbsp;    Neg : I'm worried about how I'm going to hide this from my mother. It felt so wrong to tell her TAFE ran late and that I then walked around shops looking for her b'day pressie. How am I going to hide it time after time? I don't want to let her in... But I also know that lying isn't the best, it'll eventually catch up with me.    Pos : I am trying really hard to not dwell on this, but to try and find reasons, or ways to work around this. I'm trying to come up with other ways to get through it/around it. I guss it'll all work out in the end.\n",

I think what I'm failing to see is that I need to stop relying on professional counselling services to help me every time I'm struggling, when bad times hit me I need to to rely on my other coping strategies. Yeah sure, these services are struggling to meet the demand and it sucks because when my other supports (i.e. playing guitar) dont help me I'll need to ask them for help (i.e. eheadspace, khl) and there are also thousands of other people needing help they can't get from these places. It's unfortunate but its not all about me... and these services aren't equipped to be helping me every night that i need it, I need to be using the resources and my survival kit to help me. How they have been treating me by giving me the run around isn't fair but what I can I do?I've written a complaint to both services. I've tried my best with them to get help but now it's time to use those services appropriately and only if my other resources, like things from my survival kit, don't help me. I've got my letter drafted and ready to type up. Hopefully by me not reaching out to each of these when I need them next and instead using what I have on me to help myself first, someone who has never gotten professional help has the opportunity to.\n",

      "I was going to start this by saying that I know how you must be feeling, but then I thought it would be right down ridiculous, because I cannot pretend to know what are you going through just judging by the message above. But I can tell you that I do know what is like to feel tired. I mean really, really tired. Like if nothing were important anymore, like nobody care. Like if this is never gonna change, what's the point? Well, I am going to tell you something. A bunch of years ago, when I was still on high school and my problems where more like how to get a good grade and not how to get through the day, I met someone who saved my life. Nor he nor I knew that by then, and I think he does not even know now. And you know how he saved my life? Well, believe it or not, he went through a rough crisis when I was 15 years, and he reached me out for help. But what can you do, being only a teenager, know nothing about depression, self-harm, suicidal thoughts? Nothing. So I did nothing: I just sat there and listened, to every single word, to every single broken thought. And he kept talking, and I kept listening, and oh boy, it hurt. It hurt like hell. I loved him more than I loved myself, and every time he was going throught crisis and he didn't pick up the phone, or he didn't open the door of his room, I panicked. I remember feeling that overwhelming feeling of despair. Eventually, he got over it. It took years, it took long talks and patience, it took treatments and long nights in silence. He is okay now. He doesn't have suicidal thoughts anymore. I do. I am not that 15 year girl anymore, I have grown up, and I have been through hell and back. Sometimes, things get heavy. I mean really heavy, if you know what I mean. Heavy enough to consider giving up. And you know why I haven't give up? Because I can remember how much it hurt. I remember the despair, the anger, I remember feeling helpless. I remember telling him over and over again how much he meant to me, how much I loved him, how much the single thought of not having him in my life anymore tore me into pieces. And above all, I remember him not believing me: just like you can't believe anyone right now when they tell you that they care, that you are going to be just fine: that it will pass, eventually. And that you will be happy for sticking around just a little bit longer to know it was truth.   Who knows? Maybe you meet someone if you hold on a bit more. It doesn't have to be a romantic relationship, it can be just simple and pure friendship. And then maybe, just like him did, you can get to save a life.\n",

I've been to countless workshops where the speaker said the journey to where they were in that moment was by far the best.

Is your mum currently seeking any help? If she is it'd be great if you could encourage her to keep up with her appointments and/or medication. If not it would be great if you could support her to get some help. Telling her about how this stuff makes you feel may be a good way to begin that.  Could you perhaps make some suggestions on things to have her less lonely? See if there are any clubs or societies around the area that she could get involved in, or even suggesting online or speed dating? Both of those things have helped my mum improve by a ton.  Another possibly option could be her getting something else to help her feel less like she's got an empty nest. Perhaps rescuing an animal?

When i clean up the bathroom, help set the table, take the laundry etc. I still do nothing around the house.   Tonight he got personal.   He went into my room, violated my privacy and mixed garbage with my clothes. He then proceeded to move books that were in an organised pile onto my desk and mixed papers in between.   He also put cables and aything else he could find into the mix and left everything else on my bed.   My sister and brother get away with everything, and he is never on their case.   Has anyone had to put up with stuff like this from a parent?   Does anyone else feel like they need to leave home and never look back?   I have started a notebook gathering up things like this that I can give to someone in case something worse happens.&nbsp;   I am starting to feel really worthless and it's effecting my everyday life.   Please help me... I don't know if i can take any of this much longer.\n",

Positive: it doesn't have to akr complete sense, I got through it without self harming and I also got the help I needed. I'm proud of how I handle it despite how scared and confused I was     Negative: I didn't feel I could talk to my therapist about it all. I just wanted to push it under the carpet and move on.   Positive: we ended up talking about how I try to cover my feelings and experiences and pretend everything is fine until I explode. Another positive is that I see my psychiatrist on Wednesday and will feel more comfortable talking to him about it.     Negative: my casemanager is away for the next few weeks so I don't have the extra support. I really needed her today and ended up taking myself to DEM because I couldn't cope and had no one to talk to.   Positive: its only a few weeks. And I do have regular visits with my therapist and psychiatrist in the mean time. And there is always crisis lines or hospital if things get too out of control.\n",

      "Hey  @DistancePerson &nbsp;   &nbsp;   It's a tough road when you're looking out for a friend, and your friend is lucky to have you in their life. Everyone here has offered some great advice&nbsp;  Just here to add my 2 cents:&nbsp;   &nbsp;   What's also super important is taking care of yourself. Take some time out when you feel overwhelmed or set boundaries if you feel that you need to. Don't ever push yourself well beyond your limits or what makes you feel uncomfortable.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   I can definitely relate to what you're feeling right now about 'what if something bad happens if I'm not there?'.&nbsp;For the past three years, I've been looking out for one particular friend with severe depression. I was the go-to friend, from phone calls, FB messages, and the getaway vehicle driver when she was not feeling ok. It got to a point where I became rather bitter, and just could not do it anymore - particularly since she grew to become very ungrateful and aggressive. But I found that talking to other people (i.e professionals like GPs, a psychologist, a counsellor or a community worker) has been useful to build a support network for myself and a safety net for her.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Do you think that confiding in other supportive people (such as pros) could be a good way to go in looking out for her?It's all about making a team effort, so you're not alone in this.&nbsp; If she just likes talking to you, that's great. Even if you feel that it's useless, at least you know that in your own way, you can support her during tough times.&nbsp;\n",

So this morning I logged in as I was told to do, only to be told \"come back later he's not here\" ok I did that, half an hour later I logged in and they told me he wasn't coming in.

It's also the same dose as&nbsp;written on my&nbsp;referral for the psychiatrist....   &nbsp;   &nbsp;    Neg : Looking through my book and realising I didn't write down any notes for my focus children this last week just gone!   uho.

I know the doubt is a symptom of the illness trying to roar it's ugly head, I've been too awesome for it this morning.   &nbsp;    Neg : Part of me is still questioning if the GP was right in thinking that hospital was the best place for me right now...    Pos : What she doesn't know is how I CAN cope with things outisde of appointments etc. What I've struggled to convey is HOW I manage to get through. What I haven't managed to convey, is that despite the terrible thoughts inside my head, I don't actually want to act upon them. I don't.

I enjoy that I'm working individually but also apart of a biger team running a company.    &nbsp;    Neg : I'm often getting too caught up in everything to focus on what I want. I get too caught up in the negative to focus or function. And mostly this is in my apts with health professionals, and it's when the anxiety and fear totally take control, partly because it's easier to let them, but partly because I don't want to face facts.    Pos : I'm working towards all of this. I'm working on moving past the negative thoughts, and not letting them control me. It's just a slow process, which isn't always successful for me. I'm working on being able to talk with my health professionals. It's not something I'm very familiar with - talking alloud about this stuff, so it's going to be hard and frustrating at times.   &nbsp;    Neg : I feel like my motivation for today has disappeared. I'm feeling like I can't achieve anything more today in terms of my assessments. I'm feeling at limit right now.    Pos : I've recognised this.

      "Hey  @Bee  I'm sorry to hear you're having a rough time at the moment. Is it possible for your psych to fit you in earlier? Maybe in case there is a cancellation if they are fully booked? It might be worth looking into.   I understand what you mean at work. Having to always be on focus and on task, it was always my weak point. And then having to have the customer repeat themselves because I wasn't listening. During the dead-quiet time, try cleaning up the area around the registers, organising things, wiping down the surfaces, organising any nearby shelves, to keep yourself occupied. It can be tough during the rushes, I've been stuck alone faced with what felt like an endless supply of customers but I know you're strong and brave and capable.   I don't know if I'm helping you at all, but I want you to know I'm here for you. Even though I'm terrified of bees, you're the exception\n",

      "Hey,  I want to throw in a couple of other things to consider since you seem very torn about whether to leave or stay:    1. Maybe you don't need to make a drastic move out of state? Perhaps just to a different place in Melbourne. Melbourne is a very big place and in my experience people don't explore beyond their general area and the city all that much. Or even to a place like Geelong or somewhere a bit more country that may be further or closer away.   2. Perhaps you need a holiday/break for a little while? Could you go somewhere for even a few days or a week? That could give you a sense of whether being away feels any different.   3. (Greatly related to the last point) Moving away doesn't mean you can't come back. If you find after a couple of months that you're feeling worse, you do not have to stay there. You can move again, or you can move back to Melbourne.\n",

By saying that a change that might happen would be beyond my control and that I can't do anything about it? Why does everyone take the easy way out and assume it was already there? No it wasn't, this was casued by an article which led me to believe a change would occur beyond my control. Before that I had zero doubts about myself but I allowed an article to undermine it. That is what happened. The only decent advice I got was from another site, they said I was overthinking a new concept and being too hard on myself.

      "Re: Break downs during tests\n",
      "Hey DistancePerson,  A couple of years ago I broke down in a maths test. I'm sure I would have broken down in more, but I ended up mostly trying to then avoid them. There was a lot going on for me, so I was missing a lot of the content at school.  I remember going into that test thinking that I'd be fine since I did this theory the year before. I looked at the paper, I started, and almost none of it made any sense to me. I had forgotten everything. Other things I wasn't sure I'd ever known. It seemed like everyone else around was so content and sure in what they were doing, and the room was so quiet that my tears seemed all the more difficult to hide from myself, my teacher, or my class.  Tests are stressful. Tests when we've got a lot of other things going on are stressful. Tests when we don't know or understand the thing we're being tested on are stressful. It's okay for you to have broken down. It's also okay to ask for help in any form that you need it. - If this is with the content of the test, you can maybe ask your teacher/a friend to clarify some things, or see if you can get a tutor. If it's the stuff surrounding the test, speaking to your teacher or a school counsellor could allow a change in environment or even in the task itself. If it's about things largely unrelated to the test then asking for some help in those areas (here, to your parents, counsellors, friends etc.) is probably a great idea.  Maybe school and maths aren't meant to be your priority right now. Maybe you need to think about finding a way to speak to your parents (perhaps a letter?) about some things that you've been meaning to speak to them about? It sounds like this is a thing that you'd really like to be different. It's very likely that your parents would love for it to be more like how you'd like it to be too.\n",

Perhaps a place to start would be to think of what you appreciate in other people, and what other people appreciate in other people? Maybe that may give you an idea on the sort of things you may like to try doing.  As Safari93 said, it sounds like you're relying a lot on what other people think of you and equating their opinions on you with your worth a lot. I think it would be wonderful if you could try to think of your own beliefs a little bit more. Other people do not define you.  What things do you like about yourself? What things do you think people should appreciate about you (even if you feel that right now they don't)? What good qualities would people you know say you have? Why do the people in your life keep you in your life? I guarantee that everyone isn't just keeping you around out of pity. You offer them all something.\n",

Several of my psychologists have told me about how they're actually more used to people coming in who then don't talk for the session, or barely talk. So please don't feel embarrassed about it or anything, it's fine.   Perhaps bringing up worries about medication would be a good way to start talking a bit more? Since it's a topic that's already on the table. It's certainly a thing to consider and a worthwhile thing to ask questions about until you're comfortable with a decision to take not take it.

If that doesnt work, I&nbsp;start talking about random stuff till I feel&nbsp;comfortable enough to start talking about why I'm there. Sometimes I spent several sessions doing that till I could jump straight into dealing with the issue at the sart of the session. In terms of coping afterwards I need to go for a long walk and slowly ease my way back into things as it can feel quite disorienting to go straight from counselling to uni/work, which is why I book appointments after uni so I have the time to destress.

      "Hi sorry for the long title!...if it is long that is!   &nbsp;   Anyways I am pretty sure my friends are tired of hearing it so I figured I might as well talk about it on here and then...yeah. Also I realize this is Reachout.com for Australia but for some reason the US one isn't working and I want to get my thoughts out...   &nbsp;   Okay so I realize it is probably stupid and people have bigger problems...I mean I have bigger problems, but I don't really get emotionally attached to someone so this is weird for me.   &nbsp;   Actually Idk if I am emotionally attached quite yet but I could see myself eventually being in a relationship with them and I've been single for years - by choice, I may add - so you might see why this is weird for me.   &nbsp;   Okay so I meet this guy almost three weeks ago, we have hung out 3 times. The first night we meet and then the week following and then last week. Each time he has invited me to first hang out with him and his friends and then afterwards we go hangout together. This last time he was being extermly cute, like holding my hand in front of them and kissing me on the cheek and what not. Which I thought was weird because most guys aren't like that, we are in college btw, but I thought it was nice as well. Then later that night we went out with our different friends and then ran into each other at a party, where I got a little annoyed because I wanted to hang out but he wanted to go to the bars with his friends.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Now first of all can I just say that I hate that the legal drinking age is 21 and that I am close, yet not close enough to it. Second of all, I realize its not fair of me to be mad at him for not ditching his friends for a girl he just started to hang out with, but I was drunk so at the time it seemed like a valid reason to be mad. Anyways later that night he apoligized and told me he enjoyed seeing me and looked forward to seeing me again.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Here is the thing, he is either:   a. The absolute worst texter in the world   or   b. Not into me enough to text me.   &nbsp;   I realize this seems stupid, but you have to admit in the current age texting is sort of a big way of communication. I personally don't like long texting conversations but quick how are you would be nice! Finally my friends convienced me to just text him and ask him to hang out because he hadn't texted me for 3 or 4 days. He then informed me that he was busy this week but was free on the weekend.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Okay, I also realize finals are in 2 weeks so its crunch time. Also typing this all out has made me feel both a little crazy and a little better. It just that people always say that if a guy wants to see you then he will make time for you. So why isn't he making time for me? I mean yes for me its school, friends/family, work, and then boys but we could at least have cute study dates!   &nbsp;   I just don't enjoy feeling vulnerable or looking desperate. So if anyone has any advice please let me know.   &nbsp;   ...Also sorry for the long post, at least you can enjoy the mind of a crazy girl.\n",

I also found it on the internet but I cannot remember how or why. But I'm glad I did!&nbsp;      If you could live in any period of history, when would it be? Why?&nbsp;   At the moment (Thanks to the Percy Jackson series (and Heroes of Olympus)) I've been getting really into Greek and Roman time periods. When I was in Rome, I was disappointed with how much catholicism there was, I was looking forward to the gods but still amazing! Although I'd probably die in my teen years, it'd still be awesome!     What are you proud of?&nbsp; Lots of things really, you guys, my family, myself.&nbsp;     Tell me 10 things that we'd see when we walk in your bedroom door?&nbsp;   I have a couple of bedrooms at the moment, and a couple more coming but I will use my current one. 1- A cluttered desk. 2- A weird, couch/seat thing. 3-(windows open)mountains. 4- clothes in piles on the floor. 5- My laptop. 6- a bed. 7- A stool. 8- a rug. 9- A full bin. 10- Me if you're lucky.       What relationship are you grateful for today?&nbsp; My guest family. We're not related by blood but they still treat me like family and I am grateful for that.     Give me three words that describe you.&nbsp;   Only three? Well, some of you know me pretty well I think. One- I think I'll go with unique, it's the best word I can use to describe my weirdness, impulsiveness, and my somewhat brash honesty. Then there is kind, my friends would laugh but that's because they don't see it, not really. And... trustworthy. I'm an excellent secret keeper.&nbsp;      If you had to make an iPod playlist named after&nbsp;you, what songs would be on it?&nbsp;   Theme songs, classics from Star Wars, Avatar(Aang and Korra), Transformers(Bayverse and originals), a bunch of classical piano songs. A few good, energtic ones from Disney and a bunch of recordings of rain and storms andbackground noise kinds of things. Nature music. Quiet forests, rainy days, stormy days, mountain mornings, ect. Oh and a few, really old classic songs that are loud and energetic that would get everyone up and dancing in the good old days before all this recent pop came in.      Tell us one reason why May is KEWL.&nbsp;   One? Only one? Can I... please... have a couple more? Because there's free comic book day, Star Wars Day (May the fourth be with you, always), Ace Day(May 8th-May the Ace because puns are awesome), Meet the Aro(May 15th, for aromantics)... I had a week holidays in May this year. Oh and this year it ends on a Sunday, which is a nice conclusion to the month. (because saying Sundays start the week is just sad since it's also the week end and having the start of the week at the weekend instead of after... just no.)       &nbsp;     That is all my friends!

      "Well done on going to the doctor to talk about this!   Doctors are more like a gateway to professional help than help itself. They can certainly decide to make their own call and can prescribe you medication, but of themselves that's basically as far as it goes.They're not trained mental health professionals. They're trained a little bit, but they haven't specialised in mental health and after so long away from their training they've likely forgotten a lot of the information or they're not up to date with information. This is why he didn't give you a proper diagnosis or any actual counselling.  The only doctors trained to do such things are psychiatrists - they train as doctors (go to medical school) and then specialise in psychiatry in order to become psychiatrists.   It is absolutely worth the fears of going. Being afraid of going, and also doing what you're currently doing of wondering whether it'll help or if you're meant to recover or if this is just how you are is a very normal response to this all. Part of it (quite possibly a very big part) is going to be due to your mental health. It doesn't want you to recover, or you're so used to it that you don't really imagine a you without it. I was the same. Anxiety was such a big part of how I saw myself, it was part of what made me 'me'. And to some extent I didn't see it as an actual problem - it was just like a quirk that I'd grow out of or live with like anything else. But, it really was a problem. It still is a problem - I do still have it, but it's a way smaller problem. It doesn't stop me from doing things anywhere near the extent it used to. I'm not even sure that the majority of my responses or thoughts come from a place of unhealthy anxiety anymore. When I was seeing mental health professionals, particularly psychologists seemed to help for me, I didn't really feel like I was getting much help in the moment. But stuff that has happened in sessions from 5 years ago still comes back to me or I will realise I'm doing the things I was taught. Even in the moment when I didn't feel like it was doing anything, it's so nice to have more of an understanding of what's going on with you - which is something they'll give you. And I felt with each of my psychologists that they legitimately cared about me and wanted to help. I don't think I can adequately express how helpful that was in retrospect.

The head teacher acts shocked but still says that if I really don't want to do it I don't have to but it would be great if I could and to speak to her tomorrow. The head teacher was friendly though, I have no problem with how she acted and I feel okay about speaking with her.   &nbsp;   I'm kinda annoyed, I'm not changing my mind, their have been study days I've been though were I go \"never again\" and this time I'm putting my foot down.

Listening to music, going for a walk/run talking to someone, reading or something distracting like tv can help. It might not take the voices away but if can help drown them out.   As  @Chessca_H  said it would be really helpful to see your doctor or a psychiatrist about the voices. Medication and therapy really does help.

Her notes should already be on the system anyways. I just need to be sure, I can switch GPs and continue my mental health plan.   @ElleBelle. At first my GP was apprehensive to refer me, then she sort of was told to do it. I was in a really bad place during my last depressive episode, and people were concerned of my safety. Today my GP referred me to another psychologist. She wants me to see a psychiatrist, though I'm not sure she's done the referral for it yet. The last psychologist sort of pre-rejected me. I got a phone call the other day, I guess I have a pretty crappy medical record. I'm &nbsp;put off from seeing her anyways. It's not the best way to start a psychologist-client relationship. Having ideas of each other before we've even met.    @Myvo  I have an app with her just in case and with another doc next week. I've told her I'm willing to try again, i.e. seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist. I still have my psychologist app. Hoping that it works out this time.\n",

I am alone for most of the time, my partner works a lot, so I have plenty of time to wallow.  I'm at the age where I thought I would be past this feeling... low self esteem, drinking to cope... &nbsp;To make things even better, I don't have a strong social group due to relocation. All my friends are either very busy or transient, and I've successfully&nbsp;had 3 falling outs with people whom I considered my closest friends in the last 3 years, due to differences of opinion of how I should have conducted myself (not-drinking related).... Attempting to grow into myself and be myself seems to always be met with disappointment and rejection. I'm constantly struggling to feel secure, and&nbsp;to find someone who will&nbsp;to stand up for me, and understands me. I didn't have it in my childhood and it seems to be what I am forever looking for now. I am different, I know that now... looking back, everything I did and how I learned, was all different. I wonder if I have a form of Asperges. It would explain a lot. I feel it everyday, people find my awkward and overly confident, but really I'm so vulnerable and desperate to make any connection.  Despite all of my best intentions,&nbsp;it is never any different... this seems to be my pattern in life. True connections are never made. I am so truly lonely. In my heart, I feel so alone.&nbsp;I keep waiting for the inevitable doom, where my life collapses, I lose my job and my husband and I have an excuse to say fuck it all, you got what you wanted, I'll leave you all in peace and just disappear to an isolated place and become a nobody. There's so much less pressure when you're a nobody.  I'm writing this because I DO want to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I definitely find comfort in feeling low and feeling the effects of alcohol/drugs.... it makes me feel like someone else, and takes the pressure off my shoulders. I just am so angry that this is the life I've been dealt and that makes me resilient to change... why can't I just be normal? Why can't I just be likeable? Why doesn't anybody like me?

      "Hello there  @animallady  and welcome to ReachOut.   Have you spoken to your husband about this? Making sure the people close to you know what's going on can help them better help you. Also, how does your husband react when you verbally abuse him?   I've gone through a similar thing myself. Where the slightest thing would send me into a rage or nothing at all. I would yell for a bit, slam and/or hit a few things then storm into my room, sit on my bed and cry because I was angry and sad at myself for loosing my temper. It was an annoying cycle that I wanted to break, and sometimes it still comes back but less often now.  What I did was trying to identify what it was exactly that was causing the anger. Not the actual event (something insignificant) but why it was making me anger. What exactly I was annoyed at, usually it would be one of my siblings, they would have done something (the insignificant thing) and they would have been doing something that annoyed me and I would be angry at them, not the thing. Did that make sense?  Basically, I would be angry at whoever did the thing instead of the thing itself.   Once I identified what it was I was angry at, what I was really angry at, I used this to try and calm myself down. I focused on my breathing and exited the room without shouting or slamming or stomping.   Things you can do when you feel the anger coming depend on whose around you. The first thing you always do is focus on your breathing. You can deep breaths or normal breaths but focus on the counts, how long you breath in, hold and then let out. Counting slowly to ten while deep breathing. Either works. The next thing is that you leave the room (if there's someone else in there) or if it's where the problem is. You want to make sure you are as far away from the problem, the cause, as you realistically can.  Another thing you can do, if your husband is okay with it and if you think it would help, is go to him and talk with him. Just let him know you're feeling angry and talk with him about something. Do a lazy activity, watch a movie, listen to music, go for a walk.    Talking to someone is very important, and also work out some strategies in advance. Breathing, talking, walking, whatever it is, work out what you'll do if you feel angry before it happens so that when it does, you are prepared.   Best of luck!\n",

      "Hey  @Cathy97  and welcome to ReachOut.    You are definitely not alone in what you are feeling. I also struggle with social anxiety. Finding it difficult to be around people minus a select few and meet new people or make friends.  A lot of people don't like to stray from what is considered 'normal' or 'correct' behaviours. So if you don't fit those parameters, then they won't like you. Not all people are like this, like your close friends and family, and I'm not even sure why they are. Society is so highly rooted in our lives, learning and culture it, and most of what it says and stands for, is considered true. I struggled a lot trying to fit into those norms, I've given up now, but I do remember the pressures of fitting in and being liked.  The first thing to do is to not forget the people you have and accept and love you. Those are the people you want to keep in your life.  When trying to fit it, it is important to be yourself, even if some people don't like it. I had a weekend with other students and I was completely myself (weirdness and all) and I ended up making an awesome friend. You might find someone who likes you for you, and if you hide that you'll miss them. When it's important to be yourself, you have to be sure not to be mean to others, intentionally or not. That's where I struggle, because I don't quite understand it, but if you think someone is offended apologise. So they know that it wasn't mean in the way they thought.   It seems that you have a few close friends out there, do you think they or your family could help you too? Don't forget to talk about it with the psychiatrist, friends or family. Talking can help relieve some of the pressures and they might be able to help you out.  N1ghtW1ng\n",

Saying that you want help is the first step.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   I just want to reinterate what&nbsp; @j95 &nbsp;said in that seeking help online is just as valid as seeing someone in person. It can be pretty daunting talking about your emotions. I guess this is because when doing so, we are pretting much exposing ourselves in which we are in a vunerlable position. There are people out there that generally want to help and laying it all out on the table to someone who doesn't want to help can be quite discouraging. And I am just rambling here and probably went off track.   &nbsp;   I guess the best place to start if you are not into the whole online stuff is with your GP. Talking about all these things can be hard, like you said, so if you find it easier, just write down everything that you want to say. And then the GP should work with you on what is the best solution for you.   &nbsp;   There are many places you can seek help online such as  eheadspace ,  beyondblue &nbsp;(1300 22 4636), and  kids helpline &nbsp;(1800 55 1800). If you find yourself in a crisis situation, there is always  lifeline &nbsp;(13 11 14). Remember that if it is an emergency to always use emergency services.   &nbsp;   If this all seems overwhelming, just take a deep breath and proceed when you are ready.   &nbsp;   Hope to see you around the RO community, we are a really supportive bunch!   &nbsp;   stonepixie   &nbsp;   P.S.

      "All this talk about taco's has reminded me of the last time I was home and has me wanting Taco's. Boo!   &nbsp;   Anyway ... story time!   &nbsp;   Mum and Dad were talking about what to have for dinner one night. They were going through what they normally cook and both saying that they don't feel like any of that and both don't feel like cooking anything too complicated / requires a lot of attention. Without looking up from my laptop screen, I said, 'I feel like taco's'.   &nbsp;   They both looked at me, kind of in shock. I think they forgot I was home and then they both looked at each other in a questioning kind of way. Then both admitted that they wanted taco's. Score!   &nbsp;   .......................................   Because my parents prefer hard taco's, I have perfected the art of eating them without the stuffing falling out. So I prefer hard tacos when the meat is mince but when I have crispy chicken taco's I prefer soft.   &nbsp;   But give me a kebab&nbsp;over a burrito anyday!   &nbsp;\n",

      "So I am in year 12 and pretty soon we have to make university choices. For about a year and half now I have been pretty set on studying a course that helps underprivileged people, and whenever someone has asked me what I want to do when I leave school I have told them that. But lately I have been unsure of some of my decisions, I regret some of my subject choices in school, I wish I chose some that would help me in life, like legal, business maangement or economics and I feel I have let myself down. This has lead me to the thought that maybe the university course I have chosen is not for me either and that I am making a big mistake by choosing it, but by not chosing it and not going into a profession that helps underprivileged people I feel as though I am letting them down and that I should feel guilt for choosing not to help them. I don't necessary know what anyone could say to this but I just needed somewhere to write my feelings.\n",

I dunno.   &nbsp;   But yeah, it's true that sometimes it's just a matter of doing something fun/constructive to keep things on a general positive when I've got this high energy level, because if it gets negative it can get kinda fucked up.

Just talk to him more about his interests, get to know him so it you know him. Depending on the gathering, perhaps he is someone you could go out with to an event, someone you can trust. It doesn't have to be a romantic thing, you can tell him you want to get to know him first.   I'm sorry I'm not the best at this, romance is a little beyond me but I hope I helped, and ReachOut has some factsheets that might help you, just search for Romance in the search bar and hopefully you'll find something of help to you.

Especially some members from the old forums way back when &amp; everyone here now&nbsp;&amp; of course&nbsp; @Sophie-RO !!   &nbsp;   I had my second apt today. I had to wait about 20min to see her as she was running late, which in turn I think made the apt shorter, but that's ok. Today was much better than last week. I've still got a long way to go in terms of really trusting and opening up, but in saying that I am able to work with her. I acualy managed to make eye contact today and hold it for short periods of time!! AND I managed to SPEAK! So I want to thank you all for sticking with me and all your encouagement and support. You've all played a huge role in helping me get here!   &nbsp;   I walked out today feeling okay. She is actually understanding and listening to me, which I've not had anyone do in such a long time (face to face that is.) And despite a couple things I really struggled to explain or get out, she seemed to understand. And when I stumbled on my words trying to get it out, she didn't judge. She just waited for me, when I was ready. And on my own I was trying to calm myself and focus my attention so I could get it out. It all seems like stock standard stuff for a psychologist, but it's something I've not had in my life. Basic things like someone taking the time to really listen, being patient with me, and waiting until the resistence wears thin so I can talk.   &nbsp;   From here there's a lot going on. The psych is going to contact my TAFE teacher and find out what support can be accessed, because she thinks I need it and it'd help me cope better. I'm kinda nervous about that, but the same time we've discussed it and I'm hapy for her to do so. From there, she will also write a letter to my gp asking for some blood tests and a script for medication. Which in all honesty, as scared as I am about it, I kinda knew that it would mount to it so quickly, just because of how I've felt internally for so long, because despite all my efforts, I never really feel like I get anywhere. But it's doable I guess.&nbsp;I'm trusting her judgement and knowledge to help me because I don't know how to get out of it myself...   &nbsp;   But to re-answer&nbsp; @Sophie-RO 's question, yes I can see myself connecting with her. She's got a good balance between serisousness and humor, which helps to break it up a little bit.\n",

I'm just getting really tired of never being able to have time alone for myself to figure things out myself. Wanting to move out already!

I just don't know why it all has to be so hard!? I don't even know what I want. It feels like talking to her will be harder than I thought, maybe I over simplified it in my head? Maybe I'm over-complicating it now? What am I to do? Why do I alway have to question everything???&nbsp;    Pos : I can always try tomorrow, see which one I end up calling first?

I can manage the outcome of this. &nbsp;I'm becoming aware of some of these feelings running around inside me, thus meaning I can try to work out some strategies to cope through them.   &nbsp;    Neg : Not feeling like I have any coping strategies anymore, I remember writing a list ages ago, but I don't know what happened to it.

      "Hi All,   &nbsp;Thank you so much for all of the helpful feedback !&nbsp; it means a lot that you’re all taking the time to respond to me and make me feel important, so thank you.   &nbsp;   Understandably, I’ve been thinking back to my visits to the councillor from high school and remembering what they were like, and I always remember leaving and feeling really vulnerable .. is this a normal thing? Should I expect this if I do decide to go back to one here as well?      I think I’m a bit scared to get tangled up with a councillor again – it takes a lot of trust for me to be able to say all of this to someone’s face and I don’t like feeling so vulnerable &nbsp;.. I definitely think it has something to do with feeling like a part of me has to be “fixed” or “changed”.... I feel like if I actually do find out what’s going on (whether I fit neatly or not – thank you Sophie   ) I feel like I’ll be losing a little part of me and I think that’s what scaring me ... I feel like im going through this process more or less alone and I don’t know how I’ll feel about forcing myself to change or “get better” ... has anyone else felt like that? &nbsp;but considering everyone has really positive things to say about it, I am honestly considering working up the courage to go so thank you all for the push ..   &nbsp;   Thank you @Birdseye&nbsp;for the help about ways to avoid avoiding the councillor! Haha I really do appreciate those tips and If I decide that’s what I want to do, I promise to be gutsy enough to tell them that I expect to try to avoid them! &nbsp;    @Sophie , I completely understand that he isn’t really supposed to be trained in mental health, I guess it was just a bit of shock to build myself up that much to going and to him, it must have seemed like nothing ...     so a psychologist could eventually (attempt) to diagnose me but cant prescribe medication? That’s okay, im not very keen on going onto medication, im already on one type of tablet and im not happy to go on anymore without telling my parents – which is a whole other can of worms!   Thank you for the links about psychologists, If I go I’ll be sure to ask about the different types of counselling and working out whats right for me – that was really helpful  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   @Bee&nbsp;– see my Gp didn’t even do that? He asked a lot of questions and was like “so theres two options for people your age, these tablets or talking therapy” and I was like “im sorry, but what do I actually have?” like he didn’t even really explain how hed come to the conclusion I needed help ..     I’m glad yours was a little better! So have you followed through with your plans of going to counselling or still trying to find the right one?   &nbsp;   By your recommendation, I have contacted EHeadSpace – I sent them an email just before posting this, explaining my situation and asking for what the recommended “next step” should or could be .. so thank you to everyone that recommended them, ive finally done that too..   &nbsp;    I’m sorry this is so long , and thank you so much to everyone that has taken time out of their own busy lives to help me with mine – you have no idea how much it truly means to me.\n",

I'm sure she's used to, or understanding of, people not being talkative or responsive on phones. And you did still say things!! That's great. You said enough to get an appointment made, and that is really the important part of this.  Not just hanging up the phone and/or avoiding the phone is also a really great thing that you've done.

      "We're often told about how it's best to listen to our gut feelings. This often is the case, but if it's going into overdrive maybe a part of you is creating the bad feeling.  Perhaps you could try to keep a relationship going for a while without really much/any real opening up. Talk to them about the trivial things, the things going on in your life at the moment such as something you just watched or read, also things that you've come across that you're interested in doing/seeing.   You don't have to talk deeply with people for them to be friends. As you talk to them more generally you may find that they naturally open up and talk about more serious or deep issues, and that often really helps. We don't want to be the only person in the relationship putting personal parts about ourselves out there, and as long as we don't start that really early in the relationship (in my experience) that's not how it ends up.  You can also have less contact with a person without having really pushed them away. You can not speak to someone for a couple of weeks, then every day for a few days. You can not really have contact for a month and then arrange to have a coffee together. Chances are they're not going to see this small lull as a reason to have given up on you as a friend or no longer be interested in you as a friend. They probably still think of you as a friend, just one they haven't spoken to very recently and would love to hear from.\n",

      "Hey,  Everyone else has given you some great and important advice and information that I'm not going to repeat.  I just wanted to say that one of the best things you can do for this friend is exactly what you are doing - being there for her and not judging. I'm sure she finds it a great relief and comfort to know that she has you. You should let her know how important she is to you and don't be afraid to let her know about how you'd feel if anything happened to her. If there is a time of crisis where you're not available for any reason it could be a really nice comfort or motivation to know that you care, and you want her here, and that you even rely on her too.  But, try not to do that in any way that should be making her feel guilty for coming to you or for anything that happens.   Letting her know this and be aware that you do want to help may also let her give you some idea on what she needs/wants from you. For example maybe she really just needs to rant to you rather than being given advice, or maybe she wants you to distract her.  And I want to reiterate the point that anything that does happen - steps backwards, decisions not to get help etc. is not your fault, not something to blame yourself for, and not something that you have to carry alone.  You need to make sure you take care of yourself. These situations can be really hard and stressful for the person in your position - and it's completely okay to feel a bit drained or swallowed up by it. Feeling like you can't take it doesn't make you a bad friend or a bad person. It just means that it's a really big issue that may need more help.\n",

      "Re: Diagnosis\n",
      "I'm just glad I can offer any help    What you were expecting is a bit more like what could happen at a psychologist or psychiatrist appointment. Usually the first session with one will be very much about getting to know you - so they'll ask about your family/living situation, they'll ask about what you do with your time (working/school) and ask you why you've come to see them.  I remember doing some surveys with my psychologists, but I don't remember if they were in the first session, second session or way later ones. And I'm not sure how common practice it really is or if my surveys were more program specific.   I'm pretty certain that a psychologist can give you a diagnosis (mine was by one), but if Sophie has other information I'd trust her to be right. However, do be aware that they may not be able to give you a diagnosis from the first session. This isn't anything about them compared to psychiatrists, it's just that sometimes it takes a bit more than one session for them to have certainty in any diagnosis or you may not even exactly fit a diagnosis. This isn't anything bad about you. It doesn't mean that you're not as bad as you others and not deserving/needing of help or that you're a really weird case.  I'm pretty certain I was diagnosed in my first session, I just think it's important to be aware that it may take a bit longer.  You're right about it largely being on you. But if you decide that you do want to continue to see a certain psychologist there are things that can help. Firstly, that we have to make appointments can help a lot with this. With my school it was much more of a dropping in whenever sort of deal than them actually expecting to see you at a certain time. If you miss an appointment rather than cancelling in my experience they'll make some sort of contact with you. When I cancelled appointments it would also  be brought up. I know several members also email their mental health professionals, so maybe that could be an option for you too. If you find someone you like you may want to mention this worry of avoiding and then not taking it upon yourself to reconnect again so they may be able to figure out some ways to lessen the likelihood.   Yep, I get what you're saying. Reminding yourself that they want to help and that there's nothing they haven't heard before may help with that fear. They're not there to judge you, they just want to help you.  If we think about it, it's more likely to work out than not going.\n",
